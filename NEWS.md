# mupet 0.1.0

Implementation of custom 'tidymodels' metrics for multi-class
prediction models with a single negative class. Currently are implemented:

* macro-average sensitivity through `macro_average_sensitivity()`;
* macro-average specificity through `macro_average_specificity()`;
* a generalized weighted Youden index through `weighted_youden_index()`.
