Description: Implementation of custom 'tidymodels' metrics for multi-class
    prediction models with a single negative class. Currently are implemented
    macro-average sensitivity and specificity as in Mortaz, Ebrahim (2020)
    "Imbalance accuracy metric for model selection in multi-class imbalance
    classification problems” <doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106490> and a
    generalized weighted Youden index as in Li, D.L., Shen F., Yin Y., Peng
    J.X and Chen P.Y. (2013) “Weighted Youden index and its
    two-independent-sample comparison based on weighted sensitivity and
    specificity” <doi:10.3760/cma.j.issn.0366-6999.20123102>.
